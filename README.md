# SafeExamPwner
A batch script to make your VM undetectable from Safe Exam Browser (SEB), the anti-cheat browser used by most schools and universities to make students take exams. This script has been made in March 2020 (start of the pandemic, start of online exams) but still these flaws have not been fixed.

# Usage
You'll need to run this in your VM (not in your host). Right click > Run as administrator, it'll automatically do the rest and then close. Keep in mind that the registry values edited by this script automatically restore after every reboot, so you'll need to re-run this each time.

# How to restore
Reboot Windows.

# Disclaimer
I'm NOT responsible for what you'll do with this script or for any loss or damage caused by it. Use at your own risk. This is for demonstration use only, does not encourage cheating during exams, and has never been tested or used for any illegal purpose. This script has been published only to make SEB developers aware of these flaws so that they can be fixed in future SEB updates.
